## Recent Updates (April 2, 2026)

### Event-Scoped Media Library (April 2, 2026)
- [x] `eventId` (nullable FK, CASCADE) added to `MediaFile` model; existing org-wide media unaffected
- [x] `GET/POST /api/events/[eventId]/media` — upload/list images scoped to a specific event; same magic-byte validation, 2MB limit, and rate limit as global route; storage orphan cleanup on DB failure
- [x] `DELETE /api/events/[eventId]/media/[mediaId]` — ownership-checked delete
- [x] `useEventMedia` / `useUploadEventMedia` / `useDeleteEventMedia` React Query hooks
- [x] `/events/[eventId]/media` page — drag-and-drop upload zone, image grid, copy URL, delete; accessible from event sidebar under Tools
- [x] Sidebar reorganised: 7 event nav sections merged to 4 (Overview, Manage, Abstracts, Tools, Config)

### Stripe Refund + Webhook Gap Coverage (April 2, 2026)
- [x] `POST /api/events/[eventId]/registrations/[registrationId]/refund` — admin-initiated full refund via Stripe; optimistic DB lock prevents concurrent duplicates; idempotency key; storage rollback on Stripe failure; refund confirmation email to attendee; admin in-app notification
- [x] Webhook: `checkout.session.expired` resets PENDING → UNPAID (prevents permanently stuck registrations)
- [x] Webhook: `charge.refunded` auto-updates `paymentStatus` + `Payment.status` → REFUNDED when refund issued via Stripe Dashboard
- [x] Webhook: `payment_intent.payment_failed` logged for production visibility
- [x] "Issue Refund" button on registration detail sheet (admin/organizer only, visible when PAID)
- [x] `refund-confirmation` email template added

### EventsAir-Style Abstract Expansion (April 2, 2026)
- [x] `VIDEO` and `WORKSHOP` added to `PresentationType` enum
- [x] `WITHDRAWN` added to `AbstractStatus` enum; submitters can withdraw from SUBMITTED/REVISION_REQUESTED
- [x] New `RecommendedFormat` enum (ORAL, POSTER, NEITHER); reviewers select recommended format during review
- [x] New `AbstractTheme` model; organizers manage event-specific themes in Settings → Abstract Themes; theme badge shown on abstract cards
- [x] New `ReviewCriterion` model; organizers configure weighted criteria (weights must sum to 100%) in Settings → Review Criteria
- [x] `criteriaScores` (JSON snapshot) stored on Abstract; `reviewScore` auto-computed as weighted average; plain 0-100 fallback when no criteria configured
- [x] Theme filter added to abstract list view; withdrawn count shown in stats row
- [x] Idempotent SQL migrations for all schema changes (`prisma db execute` compatible with Supabase pooled connections)

### Recent Improvements (March 2026)

#### Tax Calculation System
- [x] `taxRate` (Decimal), `taxLabel` fields on Event model for per-event tax configuration
- [x] Tax config UI in Settings → Registration tab
- [x] Registration form shows price + VAT breakdown before checkout
- [x] Stripe checkout sends base price + tax as separate line items (removed `automatic_tax`)
- [x] PDF quote/proforma includes tax breakdown with configurable tax label
- [x] Confirmation page, registrant portal, and admin detail sheet all display tax breakdown
- [x] Payment confirmation email includes tax amount

#### Stripe Payment Flow Fixes
- [x] PricingTier fallback: checkout handles missing `pricingTier` gracefully instead of failing
- [x] Double-click protection on Pay Now / checkout buttons
- [x] Tax amount included in confirmation email (was previously omitted)
- [x] Correct zero-decimal currency handling for tax calculations

#### SendGrid as Alternative Email Provider
- [x] Added `@sendgrid/mail` package as alternative to Brevo
- [x] Auto-selected via `SENDGRID_API_KEY` env var; `EMAIL_PROVIDER` env var for explicit selection
- [x] Both providers coexist in `src/lib/email.ts` with unified `sendEmail()` interface
- [x] No code changes needed when switching providers — just change env vars

#### Error Logging Audit
- [x] Fixed 20 silent `catch` blocks across API routes that swallowed errors without logging
- [x] All catch blocks now log via `apiLogger.error()` with context before returning error responses
- [x] Improved debugging visibility for production issues

#### organizationId Null Fixes for SUBMITTER/REGISTRANT
- [x] Fixed API routes that assumed non-null `organizationId` for org-independent roles
- [x] SUBMITTER and REGISTRANT users (with `organizationId: null`) no longer hit 500 errors on event-scoped operations
- [x] Consistent null-safe handling across all role-scoped query paths

#### registrationType Field Cleanup
- [x] `ticketTypeId` confirmed as single source of truth for registration type
- [x] `attendee.registrationType` text field auto-synced from `ticketType.name` on create and type change
- [x] Removed `registrationType` from registration edit forms and Zod schemas to prevent drift
- [x] CSV export uses `ticketType.name` directly

#### Registration Flow Review Fixes
- [x] XSS: sanitized user-provided HTML content in registration welcome/terms fields
- [x] Attendee isolation: registration queries scoped to prevent cross-registration data leakage
- [x] Pricing validation: server-side price verification against ticket type configuration
- [x] Suspense boundaries: added proper loading states to registration flow pages

- Gradient Start: `oklch(0.65 0.155 220)` (Cerulean)
- Gradient End: `oklch(0.82 0.1 220)` (Light Blue)


### Photo Upload System & Person Entity Enhancements (February 19, 2026)
- [x] File upload infrastructure for photos (max 500KB, JPEG/PNG/WebP validation)
- [x] Upload API endpoint at `/api/upload/photo` with server-side validation and UUID-based naming
- [x] Local storage in `/public/uploads/photos/YYYY/MM/` (EC2-compatible, upgrade path to cloud storage)
- [x] `PhotoUpload` component with preview, progress indicator, file validation, and helper text
- [x] `CountrySelect` component with searchable dropdown (ISO 3166-1, 249 countries)
- [x] Added `city` and `country` fields to Attendee, Speaker, and Contact models
- [x] Added `photo` field to Contact model (was previously URL-only for Attendee/Speaker)
- [x] Updated 5 forms: registration create/edit, speaker create/edit, contacts
- [x] Updated 6 API routes with Zod schemas for photo/city/country validation
- [x] CSV export includes city and country columns
- [x] All detail views display city, country, and photo with preview

**New Files:**
- `src/app/api/upload/photo/route.ts` — File upload endpoint with validation
- `src/components/ui/photo-upload.tsx` — Reusable photo upload component
- `src/components/ui/country-select.tsx` — Searchable country dropdown
- `src/lib/countries.ts` — ISO 3166-1 country list (249 countries)

**Modified Files:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — Added city/country to Attendee, Speaker, Contact; photo to Contact
- `src/app/(dashboard)/events/[eventId]/registrations/add-registration-dialog.tsx` — Photo upload, city, country
- `src/app/(dashboard)/events/[eventId]/registrations/registration-detail-sheet.tsx` — Photo preview + edit
- `src/app/(dashboard)/events/[eventId]/registrations/types.ts` — Updated Attendee interface
- `src/app/(dashboard)/events/[eventId]/registrations/page.tsx` — CSV export with city/country
- `src/app/(dashboard)/events/[eventId]/speakers/new/page.tsx` — Photo upload, city, country
- `src/app/(dashboard)/events/[eventId]/speakers/[speakerId]/page.tsx` — Added photo edit (was missing)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/contacts/page.tsx` — Photo upload, city, country in contact form
- API routes: registrations, speakers, contacts (Zod schemas updated)

### Event Classification Fields (February 19, 2026)
- [x] Added `eventType` enum to Event model (CONFERENCE, WEBINAR, HYBRID)
- [x] Added `tag` and `specialty` fields to Event model for categorization
- [x] Updated event creation form with 3-column grid for type/tag/specialty
- [x] Updated event settings page with new fields
- [x] Updated API routes (`/api/events`, `/api/events/[eventId]`) with Zod validation

**Modified Files:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — EventType enum + eventType/tag/specialty on Event model
- `src/app/(dashboard)/events/new/page.tsx` — Event type dropdown + tag/specialty inputs
- `src/app/(dashboard)/events/[eventId]/settings/page.tsx` — Event type/tag/specialty in settings
- `src/app/api/events/route.ts` — createEventSchema with new fields
- `src/app/api/events/[eventId]/route.ts` — updateEventSchema with new fields

### Server & Database Optimization (February 10, 2026)
- [x] Speakers page: parallelized `params`/`auth()`/event/speakers queries with `Promise.all`
- [x] Event detail page: parallelized `params`/`auth()`; switched to Prisma `select` for minimal data transfer
- [x] Added composite indexes on Registration: `[eventId, status]`, `[eventId, ticketTypeId]`
- [x] Removed redundant `@@index([slug])` on Organization (duplicated `@unique`)
- [x] Narrowed middleware matcher to dashboard routes only (`/events/*`, `/dashboard/*`, `/settings/*`)
- [x] Fixed Prisma client `globalThis` caching to apply only in development

**Observed but not yet addressed:**
- `next.config.ts` missing several Radix packages from `optimizePackageImports`
- `date-fns` not in `optimizePackageImports`
- Unused tRPC dependencies in `package.json` (`@trpc/client`, `@trpc/react-query`, `@trpc/server`)
- React Query uses uniform 5-minute stale time for all data types — could be granular

### Reviewers Module (February 10, 2026)
- [x] Per-event reviewer management page at `/events/[eventId]/reviewers`
- [x] GET API returns reviewer list (cross-referenced from `event.settings.reviewerUserIds`, speakers, and users) + available speakers
- [x] POST API with dual add mode: from speakers (links `Speaker.userId`) or by email (creates standalone reviewer)
- [x] DELETE API removes reviewer from event (does not delete User account)
- [x] React Query hooks: `useReviewers`, `useAddReviewer`, `useRemoveReviewer`
- [x] "Reviewers" sidebar tab added after "Abstracts" (not visible to reviewer role)
- [x] Stats cards: Total Reviewers, Active Accounts
- [x] Add Reviewer dialog with tabbed UI: "From Speakers" picker + "By Email" form

### Schema & API Cleanup (February 18, 2026)

#### `company` → `organization` rename
- [x] Renamed `Attendee.company` → `Attendee.organization` across schema, all API routes, and all UI pages
- [x] Renamed `Speaker.company` → `Speaker.organization` across schema, all API routes, and all UI pages
- [x] Renamed `Contact.company` → `Contact.organization` across schema, all API routes, and all UI pages
  - The existing Prisma relation field `Contact.organization` (→ Organization model) was renamed to `Contact.org` to free the name
- [x] Updated all UI labels ("Company" → "Organization") across registrations, speakers, contacts, public registration form, import dialogs, CSV import/export headers, and the contact CSV template
- [x] Migration applied with `prisma db push --accept-data-loss` (only test data in renamed columns)

#### `headshot` → `photo` rename for Speakers
- [x] Renamed `Speaker.headshot` → `Speaker.photo` in Prisma schema
- [x] Updated all speaker API routes (`Zod` schema, destructuring, `db.speaker` calls)
- [x] Updated speaker UI pages (detail page, new speaker form)

#### New `photo` field for Attendees / Registrations
- [x] Added `photo String?` to `Attendee` model in Prisma schema
- [x] Registration detail sheet (slide-out): photo URL input in edit mode, photo thumbnail in view mode
- [x] API: `photo` added to `updateRegistrationSchema` Zod definition and `db.attendee.update` in `PUT /api/events/[eventId]/registrations/[id]`
- [x] `Registration.attendee.photo` exposed in GET response (already included via `include: { attendee: true }`)

#### CSV template download (Contacts page)
- [x] "CSV Template" button added to Contacts toolbar (before "Import CSV")
- [x] Client-side Blob download — no API route needed
- [x] Template includes all 8 columns: `firstName, lastName, email, organization, jobTitle, phone, tags, notes`
- [x] One example row illustrating `tags` format (comma-separated, double-quoted)

#### API key auth for `GET /api/events` (n8n / external integrations)
- [x] `GET /api/events` now accepts both session auth and `x-api-key` / `Authorization: Bearer` header
- [x] Session callers (all roles including REVIEWER/SUBMITTER) path unchanged — `auth()` → `buildEventAccessWhere` role scoping
- [x] API key callers: validated via `validateApiKey` from `@/lib/api-key`; see all org events (org-level credential)
- [x] Optional `?slug=` query param added to both branches — allows resolving a human-readable slug to an event ID
- [x] Enables zero-manual-step n8n workflows: API key → `GET /api/events` to discover IDs → `GET /api/events/{id}/speakers` etc.
- [x] REVIEWER/SUBMITTER regression avoided: `getOrgContext()` was not used here (it returns null for null-organizationId users); `auth()` handles those roles directly

**n8n workflow (before):**
1. Create API key in Settings
2. **Manual step:** open dashboard, navigate to event, copy UUID from URL bar, hardcode into every n8n node

**n8n workflow (after):**
1. Create API key in Settings
2. n8n node 1: `GET /api/events` with `x-api-key` header → JSON array with `id`, `name`, `slug`, dates
3. n8n node 2: `GET /api/events/{id}/speakers` with same header → speakers data

- `POST /api/events/[eventId]/registrations/import-contacts` — `{ contactIds, ticketTypeId }` → creates attendees + registrations in transaction

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Contacts are org-scoped (`@@unique([organizationId, email])`) — no cross-org leakage
- Event history is _derived_ (no join table) — queried live from Speaker/Registration by email match
- CSV import uses manual parser (no extra deps), handles quoted fields with embedded commas
- Import dialog remounts on open (via incrementing `key`) to avoid `setState-in-effect` lint issues
- `createMany({ skipDuplicates: true })` for idempotent CSV imports
- All list queries paginated — never loads full 100k dataset client-side

**New Files:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — Contact model + `contacts Contact[]` on Organization
- `src/app/api/contacts/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/contacts/[contactId]/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/contacts/import/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/contacts/export/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/events/[eventId]/speakers/import-contacts/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/events/[eventId]/registrations/import-contacts/route.ts`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/contacts/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/contacts/[contactId]/page.tsx`
- `src/components/contacts/import-contacts-dialog.tsx`
- `src/components/contacts/import-contacts-button.tsx`

**Modified Files:**
- `src/hooks/use-api.ts` — 7 new hooks + `contacts`/`contact` query keys
- `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` — Contacts nav item (after Events, hidden for REVIEWER/SUBMITTER)
- `src/app/api/events/[eventId]/speakers/import-registrations/route.ts`
- `src/components/speakers/import-registrations-dialog.tsx`
- `src/components/speakers/import-registrations-button.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/events/[eventId]/speakers/page.tsx` — Import from Registrations button (replaced Import from Contacts)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/events/[eventId]/registrations/page.tsx` — Import from Contacts button

### Title & Registration Type Fields + Sentry Client Instrumentation (February 26, 2026)

#### Title field across all person models
- [x] Added `Title` enum to Prisma schema (MR, MS, MRS, DR, PROF, OTHER)
- [x] Added `title Title?` to Attendee, Speaker, and Contact models
- [x] Created `TitleSelect` dropdown component (`src/components/ui/title-select.tsx`)
- [x] Created shared `titleEnum` Zod schema (`src/lib/schemas.ts`) used across 9+ API routes
- [x] Added `formatPersonName()` and `getTitleLabel()` helpers to `src/lib/utils.ts`
- [x] Updated `PersonFormFields` shared component with TitleSelect in 3-column grid `[100px_1fr_1fr]`
- [x] Updated all standalone forms (speaker edit, contact edit, registration detail sheet, public registration)
- [x] All display views (registration table, speaker list/detail, contact list/detail, breadcrumbs) now show title prefix via `formatPersonName()`
- [x] CSV export (registrations + contacts) includes title column

#### Registration Type field across all person models
- [x] Added `registrationType String?` to Attendee, Speaker, and Contact models
- [x] Created `RegistrationTypeSelect` component (`src/components/ui/registration-type-select.tsx`) — fetches TicketType names when `eventId` provided, falls back to plain text input otherwise
- [x] Updated `PersonFormFields` with `RegistrationTypeSelect` alongside specialty field
- [x] Updated all standalone forms and API routes with Zod validation + DB writes
- [x] CSV export (registrations + contacts) includes registrationType column

#### Sentry client-side instrumentation
- [x] Created `src/instrumentation-client.ts` with DSN from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` env var and replay integration
- [x] Deleted old `sentry.client.config.ts` (prevents duplicate `Sentry.init()`)
- [x] Replay: 10% session sample rate, 100% on error

**New Files:**
- `src/instrumentation-client.ts` — Sentry client initialization (Next.js 15+ convention)
- `src/lib/schemas.ts` — Shared Zod schemas (`titleEnum`)
- `src/components/ui/title-select.tsx` — Title enum dropdown
- `src/components/ui/registration-type-select.tsx` — Registration type dropdown with event context

**Modified Files:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — Title enum + title/registrationType on 3 models
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — `formatPersonName()`, `getTitleLabel()`
- `src/components/forms/person-form-fields.tsx` — Title + registrationType fields, eventId prop
- 9 API routes — Zod schemas + DB writes for title/registrationType
- 7 display pages — `formatPersonName()` for name rendering with title prefix
- `src/app/api/contacts/export/route.ts` — title + registrationType in CSV export
- `src/app/(dashboard)/events/[eventId]/registrations/page.tsx` — title + registrationType in CSV export

**Deleted Files:**
- `sentry.client.config.ts` — Replaced by `src/instrumentation-client.ts`

---

### Sentry Error Monitoring & CI/CD Hardening (February 24, 2026)

#### Sentry integration
- [x] Installed `@sentry/nextjs@10` via Sentry wizard
- [x] `src/instrumentation-client.ts` — session replay (10% sample, 100% on error) with DSN from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` env var (replaced old root-level `sentry.client.config.ts`)
- [x] `sentry.server.config.ts` / `sentry.edge.config.ts` — server and edge runtime error capture
- [x] `src/instrumentation.ts` — `register()` loads server/edge configs; `onRequestError` captures server-side route errors (Next.js 15+ hook)
- [x] `src/app/global-error.tsx` — root React error boundary, calls `Sentry.captureException` for client-side crashes
- [x] `next.config.ts` wrapped with `withSentryConfig`; `org`/`project`/`authToken` read from env vars
- [x] Sentry source map upload wired into GitHub Actions Build step via `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` / `SENTRY_ORG` / `SENTRY_PROJECT` secrets

**New Files:**
- `src/instrumentation-client.ts` (replaced root-level `sentry.client.config.ts`)
- `sentry.server.config.ts`
- `sentry.edge.config.ts`
- `src/app/global-error.tsx`

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` — Internal Integration token (Sentry → Developer Settings → Internal Integrations)
- `SENTRY_ORG` — Sentry org slug
- `SENTRY_PROJECT` — Sentry project slug

#### Blue-green zero-downtime deploy
- [x] `scripts/deploy.sh` — builds inactive slot, health-checks it, switches nginx upstream, stops old slot
- [x] Database migrations run via builder-stage Docker container before traffic switches (full `node_modules` available; `DIRECT_URL` used to bypass connection pooler)
- [x] `docker run --env-file` quote-stripping fixed — values extracted and unquoted via `sed` before passing as `-e "DATABASE_URL=..."`)
- [x] All rollback paths (migration failure, health check, nginx config) now `stop` + `rm -f` the failed container
- [x] Migrator image (`ea-sys-migrator`) tagged from cached builder stage (~1s), removed after migrations complete

#### GitHub Actions CI/CD improvements
- [x] Removed broken `npm install @lightningcss/linux-x64-gnu` workaround (wrong scoped package name; no longer needed after lockfile fix)
- [x] Removed redundant lightningcss binding verification step
- [x] SSH `command_timeout` increased from `15m` → `25m` (Docker build + health check on t3.large was tight)
- [x] Sentry source maps uploaded during Build step in CI

#### npm lockfile stability
- [x] Root cause: `npm install` on macOS only resolves platform-specific optional binaries for the current OS; Linux binaries were absent from `package-lock.json`, causing `npm ci` to fail on GitHub Actions (Linux) with `Invalid Version`
- [x] Fixed by pinning Linux binaries in `optionalDependencies`:
  - `lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu: 1.30.2` (TailwindCSS CSS engine)
  - `@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu: 4.1.18` (TailwindCSS v4 native compiler)
- [x] Lockfile regenerated; all 760 packages have valid version fields

#### Dockerfile improvements
- [x] Builder stage: `COPY package.json package-lock.json` + `npm ci` replaces `npm install` without lockfile — deterministic builds, faster due to lockfile cache layer
- [x] Runner stage: removed incomplete `node_modules/prisma` copy (missing `effect` transitive dep); migrations now run from the builder stage instead

---

### Fixes & Enhancements (February 23, 2026)

#### Specialty field on Abstract
- [x] Added `specialty` field to `Abstract` model (Prisma schema)
- [x] Added to create/edit Zod schemas and `db.abstract.create/update` in API routes
- [x] `SpecialtySelect` added to Submit Abstract dialog and Edit Abstract dialog on abstracts page
- [x] SUBMITTER role can set specialty on own abstracts (not restricted as a review field)

#### Speaker `specialty` field
- [x] Added `specialty String?` to `Speaker` model in Prisma schema
- [x] Updated submitter registration API (`POST /api/public/events/[slug]/submitter`) to accept and store specialty
- [x] Updated speakers POST/PUT API routes to accept `specialty`
- [x] Added `SpecialtySelect` to the public abstract submitter form (`/e/[slug]/submitAbstract`)

#### TagInput chip component
- [x] Created `src/components/ui/tag-input.tsx` — badge chips with × to remove, Enter/comma to add, Backspace on empty removes last tag; no duplicates
- [x] Replaced comma-string `<Input>` tag fields in `PersonFormFields`, `RegistrationDetailSheet`, and the contacts form
- [x] Contacts form state changed from `tags: string` to `tags: string[]`

#### Photo upload fixes
- [x] Fixed photo not saving: removed `z.string().url()` from 5 API route Zod schemas — upload returns relative paths (`/uploads/photos/...`) which `.url()` rejects
- [x] Fixed contacts POST not persisting `photo`, `city`, `country` (were validated but missing from `db.contact.create`)
- [x] Added `src/app/uploads/[...path]/route.ts` — Next.js standalone mode does not serve `public/` directory automatically; this catch-all handler streams uploaded files with correct `Content-Type` and `Cache-Control: immutable` headers; includes path-traversal protection

#### Public URL restructure
- [x] `/e/[slug]` is now a server-side redirect to `/e/[slug]/register`
- [x] Full submitter registration form moved to `/e/[slug]/register`
- [x] Abstract submission URL widget added to abstracts page (organizer/admin only) — copyable link with description

#### Docker deployment fix
- [x] Fixed container naming conflict in GitHub Actions deploy workflow
- [x] Replaced `docker compose up -d --no-deps ea-sys` with `docker compose down --remove-orphans && docker compose up -d`
- [x] Prior failed deployments left hash-prefixed orphan containers that caused "already in use" errors on next deploy

#### PersonFormFields shared component
- [x] Created `src/components/forms/person-form-fields.tsx` — reusable fields block (name, email, org, job title, photo, city/country, specialty, tags, bio, website, dietary) used across registrations, speakers, and contacts forms

---

### EC2 Production Deployment (February 18, 2026)
- [x] Docker multi-stage build (builder + runner stages, `node:22-slim`)
- [x] `docker-compose.prod.yml` — production compose file with `ea-sys` service on port 3000
- [x] nginx reverse proxy with HTTP→HTTPS redirect, gzip, security headers, long-cache for `/_next/static/`
- [x] SSL via Let's Encrypt — automated renewal with `certbot-dns-godaddy` plugin (no manual renewal needed)
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) — triggers on push to `main`; runs tsc + lint + build (with Sentry source map upload), SSHes into EC2, runs `scripts/deploy.sh`
- [x] Blue-green deploy (`scripts/deploy.sh`) — builds inactive slot, runs DB migrations via builder-stage container, health-checks on `/api/health`, switches nginx upstream, stops old slot; zero downtime
- [x] systemd service (`ea-sys.service`) — Docker container auto-starts on EC2 reboot
- [x] Elastic IP associated to EC2 instance for stable DNS
- [x] Docker data root moved to `/mnt/data` (30 GB attached EBS volume) — keeps root volume free

**Infrastructure:**
- Platform: AWS EC2 t3.large (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM) — `me-central-1` region
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Domain: `events.meetingmindsgroup.com`
- Container: Docker Compose (`docker-compose.prod.yml`)
- Reverse proxy: nginx (system service)
- SSL: Let's Encrypt via certbot + GoDaddy DNS plugin (auto-renews)
- Deploy: GitHub Actions → SSH → git reset → docker compose build + restart

**Disk Layout:**
| Mount | Device | Size | Notes |
|-------|--------|------|-------|
| `/` | `/dev/root` | 8.7 GB | OS + app code only (~57% used) |
| `/mnt/data` | `/dev/nvme1n1` | 30 GB | Docker data root (images, volumes, build cache) |
| `/boot` | `/dev/nvme0n1p16` | 881 MB | Boot partition |

Docker data root configured in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:
```json
{ "data-root": "/mnt/data/docker" }
```

**Disk Maintenance:**
- `docker image prune -f` runs automatically after each deploy (removes dangling images)
- All Docker storage (images, volumes, build cache) lives on `/mnt/data` — root volume stays clean
- Run `docker system prune -af` on `/mnt/data` if the data volume fills up

**New Files:**
- `Dockerfile` — multi-stage Docker build
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` — production compose with template blocks for future apps
- `deploy/nginx.conf` — nginx SSL config with template for additional apps
- `deploy/setup.sh` — one-time EC2 server setup script
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- `.dockerignore` — excludes node_modules, .env, .next, logs

### Authenticated Abstract Submission via SUBMITTER Accounts (February 16, 2026)
- [x] SUBMITTER role — org-independent restricted user (mirrors REVIEWER pattern)
- [x] Submitter account registration at `/e/[slug]/register` (public, no auth)
- [x] Registration API at `POST /api/public/events/[slug]/submitter` — creates User (role=SUBMITTER) + Speaker linkage
- [x] Checks `event.settings.allowAbstractSubmissions` and `abstractDeadline` before accepting
- [x] Find-or-create Speaker by `(eventId, email)` on registration
- [x] Event scoping: submitters see only events where they have a linked Speaker record
- [x] Abstracts page: SUBMITTER view shows only own abstracts, submit dialog auto-selects speaker, edit button for DRAFT/SUBMITTED/REVISION_REQUESTED
- [x] Review actions hidden for submitters; review feedback shown read-only
- [x] `denyReviewer()` guard blocks both REVIEWER and SUBMITTER on all non-abstract write endpoints
- [x] Middleware redirects SUBMITTER from non-abstract routes to abstracts (same as REVIEWER)
- [x] Sidebar shows only "Events" globally, only "Abstracts" in event context for SUBMITTER
- [x] Dashboard redirects SUBMITTER to `/events`; header shows "Submitter Portal"
- [x] Status notification emails sent to speaker when reviewer changes abstract status
- [x] "Call for Abstracts" card on public event page (`/e/[slug]`) links to registration
- [x] Public event API extended with tracks and abstract settings
- [x] Email templates: `abstractSubmissionConfirmation`, `abstractStatusUpdate`

**New Files:**
- `src/app/api/public/events/[slug]/submitter/route.ts` — Submitter account creation
- `src/app/e/[slug]/register/page.tsx` — Submitter registration form

**Modified Files:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — `managementToken` on Abstract, `SUBMITTER` in UserRole
- `src/lib/email.ts` — `abstractSubmissionConfirmation` + `abstractStatusUpdate` templates
- `src/lib/auth-guards.ts` — `denyReviewer()` now blocks SUBMITTER too
- `src/lib/event-access.ts` — `buildEventAccessWhere()` adds SUBMITTER branch (`speakers.some.userId`)
- `src/middleware.ts` — Redirects both REVIEWER and SUBMITTER from non-abstract routes
- `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` — SUBMITTER nav filtering (Events only, Abstracts only)
- `src/components/layout/header.tsx` — "Submitter Portal" fallback
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` — Redirect SUBMITTER to `/events`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/events/[eventId]/abstracts/page.tsx` — SUBMITTER-specific view (own abstracts, edit, no review actions)
- `src/app/api/events/[eventId]/abstracts/route.ts` — SUBMITTER filter + speaker ownership validation
- `src/app/api/events/[eventId]/abstracts/[abstractId]/route.ts` — SUBMITTER edit restrictions + status notification emails
- `src/app/api/public/events/[slug]/route.ts` — Tracks + abstract settings in response
- `src/app/e/[slug]/page.tsx` — "Call for Abstracts" link to `/e/[slug]/register`

### Org-Independent Reviewers (February 11, 2026)
- [x] `User.organizationId` made nullable in Prisma schema
- [x] Reviewers created with `organizationId: null` — not tied to any organization
- [x] One reviewer can be invited to events across multiple organizations
- [x] `buildEventAccessWhere()` removes org filter for reviewers — scoped only by `event.settings.reviewerUserIds`
- [x] Auth system (NextAuth) handles nullable `organizationId` in JWT/session callbacks
- [x] Dashboard redirects reviewers to `/events` (no org dashboard data)
- [x] Header shows "Reviewer Portal" fallback for org-less users
- [x] Cross-org check removed from `findOrCreateReviewerUser()` — existing reviewers can be re-assigned to any org's events
- [x] All 30+ admin-only API routes use non-null assertion (`!`) for `organizationId` (safe behind `denyReviewer()` guard)

### Reviewer API Access Hardening (February 10, 2026)
- [x] Created `src/lib/auth-guards.ts` with reusable `denyReviewer()` helper
- [x] Added 403 Forbidden guard to **29 POST/PUT/DELETE handlers** across **20 API route files**
- [x] Registrations: POST, PUT, DELETE, check-in, email — all blocked for reviewers
- [x] Speakers: POST, PUT, DELETE, email — all blocked for reviewers
- [x] Tickets (registration types): POST, PUT, DELETE — all blocked for reviewers
- [x] Sessions: POST, PUT, DELETE — all blocked for reviewers
- [x] Tracks: POST, PUT, DELETE — all blocked for reviewers
- [x] Hotels + room types: POST, PUT, DELETE — all blocked for reviewers
- [x] Accommodations: POST, PUT, DELETE — all blocked for reviewers
- [x] Bulk emails: POST — blocked for reviewers
- [x] Registrations page split into 4 focused files (~68% reduction in main page size)

### Reviewer Event Visibility Hardening (Updated February 10, 2026)
- [x] Reviewer access remains limited to events where the reviewer is explicitly assigned.
- [x] Reviewer sidebar event navigation now shows only **Abstracts** (no Overview or other event modules).
- [x] Middleware now redirects reviewers to `/events/[eventId]/abstracts` for any non-abstract event route.
- [x] Direct URL access to event overview, registrations, tickets, schedule, accommodation, speakers, and event settings is blocked for reviewers.
- [x] Final reviewer experience target achieved: reviewer users see only abstracts inside an event context.
- [x] **Event creation blocked**: "Create Event" button hidden from events list page for REVIEWER role.
- [x] Middleware redirects reviewers from `/events/new` to `/events` (previously redirected to non-existent `/events/new/abstracts`).
- [x] Events list page now uses `buildEventAccessWhere` to scope query — reviewers only see assigned events (was showing all org events).
- [x] **Write-action UI hidden for reviewers**: Speakers page (Add Speaker button), Schedule page (Add Track, Add Session, edit/delete buttons on tracks and sessions), Registrations page (Add Registration, Share Link), Registration detail sheet (Edit, Check In, Send Email, Delete, status management dropdowns).

### User Invitation System (Complete)
- [x] User invitation email template with Cerulean Blue gradient header
- [x] Secure invitation token generation (32 bytes, 7-day expiry)
- [x] Token storage in VerificationToken table
- [x] Updated organization users API to send invitation emails
- [x] Accept invitation API endpoint (GET for validation, POST for password setup)
- [x] Accept invitation UI page with form validation
- [x] Email verification on invitation acceptance
- [x] Audit logging for invitation actions
- [x] Settings page updated with toast notifications (replaced temp password alert)
- [x] Loading states and disabled states during invitation submission

**New Files:**
- `src/app/api/auth/accept-invitation/route.ts` - API endpoint for invitation acceptance
- `src/app/(auth)/accept-invitation/page.tsx` - UI for accepting invitations

**Updated Files:**
- `src/app/api/organization/users/route.ts` - Now sends invitation emails
- `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` - Toast notifications, improved UX
- `src/lib/email.ts` - Added `userInvitation` email template
- `src/app/globals.css` - New color scheme and gradient utilities

**Invitation Flow:**
1. Admin invites user via Settings > Team Members > Add User
2. System generates secure token, creates user with placeholder password
3. Invitation email sent with setup link (valid 7 days)
4. User clicks link, validates token, sets password
5. User redirected to login page

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/auth/accept-invitation?token=...&email=...` - Validate invitation token
- `POST /api/auth/accept-invitation` - Accept invitation and set password

- [x] Full session form with all fields (name, description, times, track, status)
- [x] Speaker assignment with multi-select checkboxes
- [x] Speaker status badges (CONFIRMED, INVITED, DECLINED)
- [x] Fetch all speakers (not just confirmed) for assignment

### Speaker Assignment Improvements
- [x] All speakers visible in session forms (regardless of status)
- [x] Status badges displayed next to speaker names
- [x] Color-coded status (green=CONFIRMED, yellow=INVITED, red=DECLINED)

### UX Improvements
- [x] Global cursor pointer styles for all interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs)
- [x] Click-once protection on form submissions (prevents double-click issues)
- [x] Disabled state styling with `cursor-not-allowed`
- [x] Loading state styling with `cursor-wait` and `pointer-events: none`

### Email Notifications (Brevo Integration)
- [x] Brevo SDK installed and configured
- [x] Email service with professional HTML templates
- [x] Speaker invitation email template
- [x] Speaker agreement email template
- [x] Registration confirmation email template
- [x] Event reminder email template
- [x] Custom notification email template
- [x] Send email to individual speaker (invitation, agreement, custom)
- [x] Send email to individual registration (confirmation, reminder, custom)
- [x] Bulk email API for multiple recipients
- [x] Email dropdown menu on speaker detail page
- [x] Fixed User model field references (firstName/lastName vs name)
- [x] Fixed Registration model to include Attendee relation for email access
- [x] DB-backed email templates (EmailTemplate model, CRUD API, per-event customization)
- [x] WYSIWYG email editor (Tiptap v2) replacing raw HTML textarea
- [x] Email preview dialog with desktop (600px) / mobile (375px) toggle
- [x] Consistent email branding: `emailHeaderImage` + `emailFooterHtml` fields on Event model
- [x] Branding wrapper (`wrapWithBranding`) applied at render time to all outgoing emails
- [x] CSS inlining via `juice` for email-client compatibility
- [x] Templates stored as body fragments (branding applied at render time, not stored per-template)
- [x] Template list inlined in Settings → Email Templates tab (no separate page navigation)
- [x] Template editor: source toggle, variable insertion sidebar, save/preview/test/reset/delete
- [x] `renderAndWrap()` helper combining variable substitution + branding + CSS inlining

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/events/[eventId]/speakers/[speakerId]/email` - Send email to speaker
- `POST /api/events/[eventId]/registrations/[registrationId]/email` - Send email to registration
- `POST /api/events/[eventId]/emails/bulk` - Send bulk emails
- `GET /api/events/[eventId]/email-templates` - List all templates for event
- `POST /api/events/[eventId]/email-templates` - Create custom template
- `GET /api/events/[eventId]/email-templates/[templateId]` - Get template + variables
- `PUT /api/events/[eventId]/email-templates/[templateId]` - Update template
- `DELETE /api/events/[eventId]/email-templates/[templateId]` - Delete custom template
- `POST /api/events/[eventId]/email-templates/[templateId]` - Preview or send test email
- `PATCH /api/events/[eventId]/email-templates/[templateId]` - Reset to default

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `BREVO_API_KEY` - Get from https://app.brevo.com/settings/keys/api
- `EMAIL_FROM` - Verified sender email address
- `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` - Sender display name

> **General Guidance:** The email template system uses Tiptap v2 (not v3). Tiptap v3 ships source-only packages without compiled `dist/` files, which breaks standard npm installs. If upgrading Tiptap, verify that the new version ships pre-compiled artifacts. The `juice` package is used for CSS inlining — it is stable and rarely changes. All email branding is applied at send time via `renderAndWrap()`, not stored in templates. System-level templates (user invitation, password reset) are hardcoded in `src/lib/email.ts` and do NOT use event branding.

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling middleware
- [ ] Implement request validation middleware
- [ ] Add API rate limiting
- [ ] Write unit tests for API routes
- [ ] Write integration tests for critical flows
- [ ] Add E2E tests with Playwright

### Performance
- [x] Implement database query optimization (parallel queries)
- [x] Add cache headers (stale-while-revalidate)
- [x] Server page query parallelization (speakers page, event detail page)
- [x] Prisma `select` on server pages to reduce query payload size
- [x] Composite database indexes on Registration (`[eventId, status]`, `[eventId, ticketTypeId]`)
- [x] Removed redundant indexes (Organization `@@index([slug])` duplicated `@unique`)
- [x] Narrowed middleware matcher to dashboard routes only (skip public/API/auth/static)
- [x] Fixed Prisma client caching (dev-only `globalThis` pattern)
- [x] `select: { id: true }` on all event existence-check queries across 25+ API route files
- [x] Parallelized independent queries in speaker/abstract detail routes
- [x] Reduced over-fetching in registration list (trimmed accommodation includes)
- [x] Split registrations page (1,246 → 393 lines) into 4 focused sub-components
- [ ] Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (add missing Radix packages + date-fns to `optimizePackageImports`)
- [ ] Remove unused tRPC dependencies (~200KB in node_modules)
- [ ] Add image optimization for uploads
- [ ] Implement pagination for large lists
- [ ] Add granular React Query stale times per data type
- [ ] Extract services layer (thin routes, reusable business logic)

### Security
- [x] CSRF protection — Origin header validation on all API mutations; missing Origin blocked for browser sessions (middleware)
- [x] `customFields` XSS prevention — replaced `z.any()` with strict `z.union([string, number, boolean, null])` on registration routes
- [x] Accommodation overbooking fix — all room create/update/delete + `bookedRooms` wrapped in `db.$transaction()` with fresh capacity checks
- [x] User list data leak fix — REVIEWER/SUBMITTER blocked from `GET /api/organization/users` via `organizationId` null check
- [x] Event settings protection — `reviewerUserIds` stripped from incoming settings in event update (managed by reviewers API only)
- [x] Import ticket capacity — EventsAir contact import checks `soldCount` vs `quantity` with atomic increment inside transaction
- [x] API key management — restricted to ADMIN+ role (previously only `denyReviewer` guard)
- [x] Implement API key authentication for external access (`GET /api/events`, `/speakers`, `/registrations` support `x-api-key` header)
- [ ] Add input sanitization
- [ ] Security audit for OWASP top 10
- [ ] Add rate limiting per user/IP

### DevOps
- [x] Vercel deployment configured (note: photo uploads not supported on Vercel)
- [x] Create deployment documentation
- [x] CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions (auto-deploy to EC2 on push to `main`)
- [x] EC2 production deployment (Docker + nginx + SSL)
- [x] Fixed Docker container naming conflict in deploy workflow (`down --remove-orphans` before `up -d`)
- [x] Blue-green zero-downtime deploy (`scripts/deploy.sh`) — health-checked slot swap, nginx upstream reload, automated DB migrations
- [x] Error monitoring via Sentry (`@sentry/nextjs`) — client crashes, server route errors, source maps uploaded in CI
- [x] Fixed `npm ci` failures on Linux (pinned `lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu` + `@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu` in `optionalDependencies`)
- [x] Dockerfile hardened: `npm ci` with lockfile for deterministic builds
- [ ] Configure staging environment
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Add performance monitoring (APM)

2. **Phase 6: Email Notifications** - Essential for user communication
3. **Phase 7: Public Registration Portal** - Required for attendee self-service
4. **Phase 10: Event Settings Page** - Complete the admin experience
5. **Phase 8: Reporting** - Important for event organizers

## Planned: Event People Overview Page

> **Context:** Speakers and Registrations remain separate entities (different workflows, data, and statuses). A unified "People" view is planned as a UI-only merge — no schema changes needed.

**Route:** `/events/[eventId]/people`

**Concept:** Client-side merge of `useSpeakers` + `useRegistrations` hooks into a single table with a **Role** column:

| Name | Email | Role | Status | Organization |
|------|-------|------|--------|--------------|
| Jane Smith | jane@example.com | Speaker + Attendee | CONFIRMED / CONFIRMED | Acme |
| John Doe | john@acme.com | Speaker | INVITED | Acme |
| Alice Wu | alice@corp.com | Attendee | CHECKED_IN | Corp |

**Key features planned:**
- Deduplication by email — persons appearing in both lists shown as a single row with "Speaker + Attendee" role
- Filter by role (All / Speaker only / Attendee only / Both)
- Quick-action column: send email, view speaker profile, view registration
- Export combined list to CSV
- No backend API changes needed — pure UI aggregation of existing endpoints

**Design note:** Same contact can be imported as a speaker into **multiple events** independently. The `@@unique([eventId, email])` constraint on Speaker prevents duplicates _within_ an event but allows the same person across any number of events. Their full cross-event history is visible on the Contact Store detail page (`/contacts/[contactId]`).
